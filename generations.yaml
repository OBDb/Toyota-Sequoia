    description: "The first-generation Toyota Sequoia was introduced as Toyota's entry into the full-size SUV segment in North America, positioned above the 4Runner and Land Cruiser in size and focused on competing directly with domestic offerings like the Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Tahoe. Based on the same platform as the Tundra pickup truck, the Sequoia featured traditional body-on-frame construction, robust dimensions, and three rows of seating accommodating up to eight passengers. Powered initially by a 4.7-liter V8 engine producing 240 horsepower (later increased to 282 horsepower), paired with a four-speed automatic transmission (later upgraded to five-speed), the Sequoia offered both rear-wheel drive and part-time four-wheel drive configurations with a two-speed transfer case. The exterior featured conservative styling with a prominent grille, squared-off wheel arches, and an overall boxy profile emphasizing its truck-based origins. The interior was spacious and practical, focused on passenger comfort and cargo versatility with split-folding second and third-row seats, though material quality was modest compared to more premium offerings. A mid-cycle refresh in 2005 brought updated styling, enhanced power, the aforementioned five-speed transmission, and additional features including available side curtain airbags, stability control, and a DVD entertainment system. The first-generation Sequoia established Toyota's presence in the lucrative full-size SUV market by offering the brand's reputation for reliability and quality in a larger package capable of towing up to 6,500 pounds while accommodating large families and their cargo, though it faced challenges competing with more established domestic competitors that offered greater power, towing capacity, and feature content."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Sequoia grew significantly larger than its predecessor, featuring more aggressive styling with a massive front grille, pronounced fender flares, and an imposing overall presence. Based on an enhanced version of the second-generation Tundra pickup platform, the new Sequoia offered improved passenger space across all three rows and increased cargo capacity. Powered initially by a 4.7-liter V8 engine, and shortly thereafter by a more modern 5.7-liter V8 producing 381 horsepower and 401 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, the Sequoia delivered stronger performance and increased towing capacity of up to 7,400 pounds. Available in rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive configurations, with a multi-mode system on higher trim levels adding a full-time all-wheel drive option, the Sequoia maintained its focus on utility while adding more sophisticated features. The interior offered significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, with available features including a power-folding third row, navigation system, premium JBL audio, and rear entertainment system. Safety features expanded to include multiple airbags, stability control, and traction control as standard equipment. A notable engineering advancement was the adoption of an independent rear suspension replacing the previous solid axle, significantly improving ride quality and interior packaging. The Sequoia received periodic updates throughout its unusually long production run, including enhanced infotainment systems, additional safety features like blind-spot monitoring, and special editions such as the TRD Sport and TRD Pro offering unique styling and enhanced off-road capability. Despite its age in later years, the second-generation Sequoia maintained appeal through its combination of robust capability, massive interior space, proven reliability, and strong resale value, particularly for buyers prioritizing durability and utility over the latest features and technology."

    description: "The third-generation Toyota Sequoia represents a comprehensive redesign of Toyota's largest SUV, featuring bold, blocky styling with a massive front grille, muscular fender flares, and an upright, imposing presence. Built on Toyota's new TNGA-F body-on-frame platform shared with the latest Tundra pickup and global Land Cruiser, the new Sequoia maintains similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor but with significantly improved interior packaging, technology, and efficiency. The most dramatic change is the powertrain, with the previous V8 engine replaced by a standard hybrid system combining a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine with an electric motor integrated into the transmission (branded as i-FORCE MAX), producing a combined 437 horsepower and 583 lb-ft of torqueâ€”substantial increases over the outgoing model. This powertrain is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case. The hybrid system delivers significantly improved fuel economy while enhancing performance and capability, with towing capacity increasing to 9,520 pounds when properly equipped. The interior features a complete redesign with a more horizontal dashboard layout, standard 8-inch or available 14-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital driver's display, and significantly improved materials throughout. A sliding second-row seat and improved third-row accommodations enhance passenger comfort, while a new feature allows the third row to slide fore and aft to balance passenger and cargo space as needed. Available in multiple trim levels ranging from the more basic SR5 to the luxury-oriented Capstone with semi-aniline leather and open-pore wood trim, the Sequoia offers configurations to suit various preferences and budgets. The TRD Pro variant continues as the off-road flagship with FOX internal bypass shocks, a front skid plate, all-terrain tires, and unique styling elements. Standard safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 offering pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise control, lane tracing assist, and automatic high beams. The third-generation Sequoia successfully modernizes Toyota's largest SUV with improved efficiency, technology, and capability while maintaining the robust, utility-focused character that has defined the nameplate."
